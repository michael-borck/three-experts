# Three Experts - Claude Code Slash Commands

A Node.js npm package that adds three powerful AI expert personas as custom slash commands to claude-code. Transform your project ideas into comprehensive documentation through a structured three-phase workflow: Product Requirements ‚Üí UI Design ‚Üí Software Architecture.

## üöÄ What This Package Does

Three Experts provides you with AI-powered expert consultants to guide you through the complete software project planning process:

1. **Product Expert** (`/create-prd`) - Generate a Product Requirements Document
2. **UX Expert** (`/create-ux`) - Create a User Interface Design Document
3. **Software Architect** (`/create-srs`) - Build a Software Requirements Specification

Each expert asks targeted questions, provides professional guidance, and generates industry-standard documentation that you can use to communicate with stakeholders, developers, and AI coding assistants.

## üì¶ Installation

### Option 1: Install with npm (Recommended)
```bash
npm install @michaelborck/three-experts
```

The commands are automatically installed via the postinstall script.

### Option 2: Install globally
```bash
npm install -g @michaelborck/three-experts
```

### Option 3: Manual installation
```bash
npx @michaelborck/three-experts install
```

## üîß How It Works

The package installs three markdown command files into your claude-code commands directory:

- **Project-level**: `.claude/commands/` (if you're in a project with a `.claude` directory)
- **User-level**: `~/.claude/commands/` (global installation)

Once installed, you can use the slash commands in any claude-code session.

## üí° Usage

### The Three-Phase Workflow

#### Phase 1: Product Requirements Document
```
/create-prd
```

The Product Expert will:
- Ask about your project idea and target audience
- Guide you through defining functional requirements
- Help create user stories and interface descriptions
- Generate a comprehensive PRD in markdown format

**Save the output** - you'll need it for Phase 2.

#### Phase 2: User Interface Design Document
```
/create-ux
```

The UX Expert will:
- Review your PRD (paste it into the chat)
- Ask about user personas and design preferences
- Present 3 different UI design options
- Create a detailed UI specification based on your choice

**Save the output** - you'll need it for Phase 3.

#### Phase 3: Software Requirements Specification
```
/create-srs
```

The Software Architect will:
- Analyze your PRD and UI Design documents
- Ask about your technical skills and preferences
- Recommend appropriate architecture patterns and tech stacks
- Generate a complete technical specification

### Example Workflow

```bash
# Start a new claude-code session
claude-code

# Phase 1: Create PRD
/create-prd
# Explain your app idea when prompted
# Save the generated PRD to a file

# Phase 2: Create UI Design (new chat recommended)
/create-ux
# Paste your PRD content when asked
# Answer design preference questions
# Save the generated UI document

# Phase 3: Create Technical Spec (new chat recommended)
/create-srs
# Attach both PRD and UI Design documents
# Discuss your technical background
# Save the generated technical specification
```

## üìÅ Project Structure

After installation, the package creates these command files:

```
~/.claude/commands/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ product-expert.md     # /create-prd command
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ux-expert.md          # /create-ux command
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ software-architect.md # /create-srs command
```

## üéØ Benefits

## üìñ Generated Documents

Each expert generates professional documentation:

### Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- Elevator pitch and value proposition
- Target audience analysis
- Functional requirements
- User stories and interactions
- User interface overview

### User Interface Design Document
- Layout structure and organization
- Core UI components
- Interaction patterns and workflows
- Visual design and color schemes
- Typography and accessibility considerations

### Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
- System design and architecture
- Technology stack recommendations
- Data flow and state management
- Authentication and security
- API design and database schema

## üîß Requirements

- Node.js 14.0.0 or higher
- claude-code CLI installed and configured
- Access to claude-code's slash command functionality

## ü§î Tips for Best Results

### When using /create-prd:
- Be specific about your target users
- Think about the core problem you're solving
- Consider what makes your solution unique
- Don't forget non-functional requirements

### When using /create-ux:
- Consider your users' technical comfort level
- Think about primary use context (mobile vs desktop)
- Balance feature richness with simplicity
- Plan for accessibility from the start

### When using /create-srs:
- Be honest about your current skill level
- Consider learning opportunities vs. deadlines
- Think about long-term maintenance
- Don't over-engineer the initial version

## üö® Important Notes

- **Start Fresh**: Use new claude-code chat sessions between phases for best results
- **Save Everything**: Keep all generated documents - they build on each other
- **Context Matters**: Always provide previous documents when moving to the next phase
- **Iterate**: Don't hesitate to refine documents based on new insights

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Commands not appearing?
1. Verify installation: `ls ~/.claude/commands/`
2. Restart claude-code
3. Try manual installation: `npx three-experts install`

### Commands not working?
1. Ensure you're using claude-code (not regular Claude)
2. Check that slash commands are enabled in your claude-code configuration
3. Verify command files have proper frontmatter syntax

### Need to reinstall?
```bash
npx @michaelborck/three-experts install
```

This package is inspired by and based on the excellent AI development workflow prompts created by Rob from Switch Dimension:

- **YouTube Video**: [AI Dev Project Setup Prompts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbcYhCE7rjE)
- **Original Notion Documentation**: [AI Dev Project Setup Prompts](https://notes.switchdimension.com/AI-Dev-Project-Setup-Prompts-18fb5b07a94380758bd6e92baa5e8c98)

The three-expert workflow (Product Manager ‚Üí UX Designer ‚Üí Software Architect) and the structured prompts were developed by Rob and have been adapted here as claude-code slash commands for easier integration into development workflows.

Special thanks to Rob for sharing these valuable prompts with the community and demonstrating how structured AI interactions can dramatically improve software project planning and documentation.
