1.1 Rob’s Voice Response to LLM Questions after First Prompt
Let me explain what Levercast is. It's an application that helps entrepreneurs manage their social media posting more efficiently. Often when I'm reading an article or taking a walk, I'll come up with an idea for a thought piece or article. I want to quickly capture that idea through voice or text input. The app has an input box where I can dump these thoughts.
The input then gets sent to an LLM that formats it based on custom template prompts I've set up in the application. It returns a tidied version of my thoughts, but it does more than that—it generates multiple versions optimized for different social platforms. For our MVP, we'll focus on LinkedIn and Twitter posts, with plans to add more platforms later.
These generated posts will appear styled exactly as they would on their respective platforms, making it easy to preview the formatting. I can also add images to my input, and the app will adapt them appropriately for each platform. I can edit any of the outputs, and when I'm satisfied, publish them directly to those platforms. We'll use OAuth to connect Levercast with LinkedIn and Twitter accounts.
In essence, Levercast helps busy entrepreneurs capture ideas and share them quickly across multiple platforms simultaneously. The key benefit is saving time while amplifying marketing efforts. As for the user interface, while I'll leave the specific design details to a professional designer, I know it will be a web application initially, with responsive design to support mobile access in the future.

2.1 UX Model Response 1
Below is a summary of our initial thoughts based on the Levercast Product Requirements Document. Before moving forward, I have a few clarifying questions regarding the user persona and design preferences:

1. **User Persona Details:**  
   - While we know the app targets busy entrepreneurs, business owners, content creators, and marketers, could you provide more details on their digital proficiency or any particular design preferences?  
   - Do they prefer a minimalistic, no-frills interface that emphasizes efficiency, or are they open to a more dynamic, visually engaging experience?

2. **Branding & Color Preferences:**  
   - Are there any existing brand colors or style guidelines we should incorporate into the design?
   - Would you like the design to offer options like a dark mode, or should we stick to a light, clean palette?

3. **Device Prioritization:**

2.2 Rob’s Response to Model UX AI Questions
On user persona details, I think these entrepreneurs are particularly digitally proficient. The selling point of this app is that it's not just another generic posting platform—it gives users the power to change their templates and properties. We're targeting more of a power user market. While others might use Buffer or Hootsuite, this is really for entrepreneurs who want to fine-tune their language, voice, and edit their own properties.
In terms of design, I prefer making things as minimalistic as possible. However, since users need options to change templates and customize settings, a balanced approach makes sense. Regarding branding and color preferences, I'll defer to your judgment based on our target market. Since we're targeting the development community and solopreneur makers, dark mode will likely be popular. For accessibility, we'll offer a light mode option as well, so our color scheme needs to accommodate both.
For devices, we're taking a desktop-first approach, but the app should be mobile responsive so users can operate it on phones and tablets. This will also inform our future React Native application development.

2.3 Rob’s Second Response 
I think out of the three options of like number two, the most let's lead with dark mode. Let's add the accent color to be yellow and. I'd like the option to be able to switch to light mode. Of course for accessibility. I'd like the main navigation to be handled in the left hand sidebar, which can be collapsed. That will have the ability to create a new post. It'll show all the recent posts. It will have a settings. and a template's link. And whenever you navigate in the left hand menu, those components are opened in the main content area and at the bottom left of the sidebar put in the the profile icon of the person when they click on that it's gonna allow them to log out.

# Levercast – Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## System Design
- **Core Goal**: Provide a platform for capturing ideas (text/voice), generating AI-driven posts for LinkedIn & Twitter, and publishing them via OAuth.
- **High-Level Flow**:  
  1. User inputs text/voice.  
  2. AI module processes input using predefined templates.  
  3. Results are displayed for LinkedIn/Twitter previews.  
  4. User edits/accepts output.  
  5. System posts to social platforms or saves drafts.

## Architecture Pattern
- **Layered (Monolithic) MVC**:
  - **Presentation Layer**: Web frontend (React or Vue).
  - **Business Logic Layer**: Node.js server with AI integration.
  - **Data Access Layer**: Database interactions (PostgreSQL or similar).
- **Rationale**: Simplified communication flow for an MVP with potential to evolve into microservices later.

## State Management
- **Front-End**:
  - Use a global state manager (e.g., Redux or Vuex) to handle user sessions, post drafts, and subscription status.
- **Server-Side**:
  - Session storage (JWT tokens) for authenticated routes.
  - Database state for posts, templates, and user data.

## Data Flow
- **Capture & Format**:
  1. User input (text/voice) sent to server.
  2. Server calls AI module with user’s template preferences.
  3. AI returns formatted content for each platform.
- **Publish**:
  1. Front-end sends publish request with selected platforms and final content.
  2. Server uses OAuth tokens to post to LinkedIn/Twitter.
  3. Server updates database with published post details.

## Technical Stack
- **Front-End**: React (with Redux or Context API), HTML/CSS, TypeScript (optional).
- **Back-End**: Node.js + Express for RESTful API, AI integration (via a language model API or library).
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data (Users, Posts, Templates).
- **Hosting**: Cloud-based (AWS, Azure, or GCP).
- **OAuth**: Integration libraries for LinkedIn/Twitter (e.g., `passport.js` or similar).

## Authentication Process
- **User Sign-Up & Login**:
  - Uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for session management.
  - Password hashing (e.g., bcrypt) for secure storage.
- **OAuth for Social Posting**:
  - Upon connecting LinkedIn/Twitter, user consents via each platform’s OAuth flow.
  - Server stores encrypted OAuth tokens to enable one-click publishing.

## Route Design
- **Public Routes**:
  - `POST /api/auth/signup` – create user
  - `POST /api/auth/login` – user login
- **Protected Routes** (JWT required):
  - `GET /api/posts` – fetch user’s posts
  - `POST /api/posts` – create AI-generated post
  - `PUT /api/posts/:id` – update/edit post content
  - `POST /api/publish` – publish post(s) to selected platforms
  - `GET /api/account` – view subscription and connected accounts
  - `POST /api/account/connect` – link social platforms (OAuth)
  - `DELETE /api/account/disconnect/:platform` – revoke social access

## API Design
- **Request/Response Structure**:
  - JSON for all requests/responses.
  - Success/failure statuses with relevant error messages.
- **Key Endpoints**:
  - **Post Creation**: `POST /api/posts`  
    - Body includes raw text/voice transcript, chosen templates, or platform preferences.
  - **AI Formatting**: Invoked internally; returns structured content for LinkedIn/Twitter.
  - **Publishing**: `POST /api/publish`  
    - Body includes references to the post ID, platform selection, and final text.

## Database Design ERD
- **Entities**:
  1. **User** (user_id, email, password_hash, subscription_level)
  2. **Post** (post_id, user_id FK, content, status, created_at, updated_at)
  3. **Template** (template_id, title, body_structure, platform)
  4. **PlatformCredential** (platform_credential_id, user_id FK, platform_name, oauth_token, oauth_secret)
- **Relationships**:
  - One **User** to Many **Post**.
  - One **User** to Many **PlatformCredential**.
  - Many **Post** to Many **Template** (if extended to allow reference to multiple templates).
